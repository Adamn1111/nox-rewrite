# Nox Rewrite
### What in the royal fuck is this?
Good question, it's Nox. Nox is a discord theme, it's pretty good, but it's pretty broken so I'm fixing it.
### Okay, who made it?
Not me. I'm just fixing it so that the guys that actually made it don't have to. The actual creators are Beard / Zeberos.
### Why is it called rewritten
Because Nox-Fixed sounds like ass. Also I spent so fucking long on it.
### How do I download it?
