# Nox Rewrite
### What in the fuck is this?
Good question, it's Nox. Nox is a discord theme, it's pretty good, but it's pretty broken so I'm fixing it.
### Okay, who made it?
Not me. I'm just fixing it so that the guys that actually made it don't have to. The actual creators are Beard / Zerebos.
### Why is it called rewritten
Because Nox-Fixed sounds like ass. Also I spent so fucking long on it.
### How do I download it?
[Here](https://adamn1111.github.io/nox-rewrite/NoxRewritten.theme.css), and then Ctrl+S
### Where is the actual Source code so that I can steal this?
[Here](https://adamn1111.github.io/nox-rewrite/import.css), and then Ctrl+S

### This rewritten version of Nox has been discontinued, as the original version of Nox has been updated. In the event that Nox breaks again, I will update this, maybe.
