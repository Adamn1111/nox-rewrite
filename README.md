This is not the official version of Nox, which is created by Beard and Zeberos (formerly Beard's Material Discord).

To-Do:

- Fix Y-Index for emoji picker in Custom Status

- Remove backing emoji from emoji picker in Custom Status (likely an opacity:onselect issue)

- Remove that stupid fuckin anim that makes the text appear when opening the status picker, will make smoother ig? Or try and remove the text completely.

- Create Radial Status in chats (for use with status-everywhere)

- Add functionality for Radial Unread Messages
